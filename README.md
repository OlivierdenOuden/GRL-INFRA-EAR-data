# FAIR INFRA-EAR data

The INFRA-EAR data that has been used within the study of "A bird's-eye view on ambient infrasonic soundscapes", submitted to Geophysical Research Letters, can be found within this GitHub repository. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) requires that the underlying data needed to understand, evaluate, and build upon the reported research be available at the time of peer review and publication. The AGU/GRL works with the FAIR data construction; the data needs to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).

The availible data within this repository consists of processed infrasound recordings by the [INFRA-EAR](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/3301/2021/amt-14-3301-2021.pdf). Raw recordings are converted intp Power Spectral density curves (PSD), following the Welch method. The PSDs are presented in Pascals, as variable of time and frequency.
